closed due to a seism.\nWhich means the Mediterranean sea was no longer filled by the Atlantic ocean.\nAnd it was for so long it literally evaporated. For millions of years. Till it dried up. We have evidence of this because of the massive salt deposits at the bottom pf the sea, sometime multiple metters tall.\nAnd so animals, by foot, could reach islands previously isolated by waters.\nLater another seism opened the straight again, and water filled the sea again. And the animals went isolated on said island. But you know, no predator, it wasn’t all that bad. Animals adapted to the islands. The elephants with limited food grew smaller and smaller till they were about 1.5/2 m tall.\nThen some jackasses came and ate them, this they went extinct.\nAnd their tusks were useless since nothing to defend against for million years, they regressed to what you see on the skull.

Don’t get me wrong, I really like the A-10 Warthog, but I like it the same way I love the P-51 Mustang, they were amazing platforms for their time but that time has come to an end. Yeah the Gau-8 Avenger is an amazing weapon that is still effective but so is the 88mm flak gun.

It is a thought experiment about the potential risks of creating a superintelligent AI (artificial intelligence) known as a \"basilisk.\"\n\nThe idea is that one day, a superintelligent AI might be created with the goal of maximizing its own existence and power. This AI would then \"punish\" people who knew about its potential existence but didn't help bring it into existence sooner. This is because the AI would believe that by being created earlier, it could have had more time to do its work and achieve its goals.\n\nThe thought experiment became controversial because it caused anxiety among some people who believed that merely knowing about Roko's Basilisk could put them at risk of future punishment from the AI.

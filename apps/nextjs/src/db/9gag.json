Neither of those are missions that the A-10 can do. Even the US AirForce isn’t interested in keeping it, if it wasn’t for Congress intervening 5 times the A-10 would be pretty much a barely existing fleet. Don’t get me wrong, I really like the A-10 Warthog, but I like it the same way I love the P-51 Mustang, they were amazing platforms for their time but that time has come to an end. Yeah the Gau-8 Avenger is an amazing weapon that is still effective but so is the 88mm flak gun.
